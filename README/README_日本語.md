It seems you've included a technical line of code or a file descriptor, which does not have a direct translation in conversational context. If you're intending to receive a translation of a specific text contained in a README.md file, please provide the text you'd like translated! 

If you are referring to a simple translation of the line itself, here is a playful way to do it:

「テキストの読み取り装置: './.README.md' モード: 'r' エンコーディング: 'utf-8'」📄✨

Let me know if you need anything else!
